**What This Project is About**
When I took ICS 215 in the spring of 2020 we needed to create an absentee ballot application using PHP which we would then need to convert it to a html file to run on Google Chrome. The absentee ballot application would ask you basic questions like your name, birthday, gender, etc. Once the user submits the application the previous answers will then be cleared and ready for the next user. The goal for this project was to get familiar with PHP and html coding. 

**My Involvement **
This project was an individual project to test my PHP and html skills. Being that this was the first class that I was learning other programming languages other than java I was scared. However, I took the assignemnt apart little-by-little and slowly got it completed. I also went back and forth between the lectures to make sure I fully understood the concepts. 

**What I Learned **
Through this project I learned about the basics in creating a functioning html program. This project allowed me to have an insight into the different functions that could be used and how to program them correctly. I programmed the ballot to make sure for each box met each parameter indicated. If it was not met it will show an error message to the user. Overall, the absentee ballot application gave me a good foundation for coding in PHP/html.
