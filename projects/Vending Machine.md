summary: In ICS 211 we needed to create a Vending Machine program that would print out the barcode, price, name, and calories of the snack of your choice.
---

For this project we needed to create 4 different classes, Snack, Snack Exception, Snack Extension, and the Vending Machine code which would allow the user to enter data which would be save to an array. The snack class was used to create and validate objects that would be entered in by the user. For the Snack Exception class this was created to notify the user that an invalid input was entered. The Snack Exception class is an extension to the Snack class which will allow a message to be printed out to the user. Lastly, for the Vending Machine class a menu would appear where the user would be able to choose from either adding a snack, removing a snack, printing all the snacks in the array, or showing snacks over a certain price.
