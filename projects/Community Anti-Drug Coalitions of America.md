I started working with HPPUD in 2018 by managing all social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook). I was in charge of making sure content was posted weekly to hopefully bring up engagements on all platforms. I was also attending small conferences here to get familiar with the line of work and slowly make connections with other departments. The following year I was then chosen to travel to Washington DC to represent the youth of Hawai'i. For this training they were preparing all the coalitions from all of the different states and territories to speak with Senators or Representatives about issues going on at home. Being the only youth representing Hawai'i I needed to prepare a speech to showcase that it is worth to continue funding prevention work whether it be for underage drinking, drug misuse, vaping, etc. We needed to make sure the Senators did not feel attacked with information, rather we were just informing them that prevention work is working we just need the continued funds for our projects. I was not only speaking for HPPUD, but I needed to speak for all of the other prevention coalitions in Hawai'i. After coming back from Washington DC I started speaking at more trainings. However, this time it was to help adults and youth connect better with each other as another approach to prevention work.
