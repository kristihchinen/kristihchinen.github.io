summary: I advocated in front of Senator Brain Schatz and Senator Mazie Hirono to fund prevention work.

I started working with HPPUD in 2018 by managing all social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook). I would then attend small conferences here to get familiar with this line of work. The following year I was then chosen to travel to Washington DC to represent the youth of Hawai'i. For this training they were preparing all the coalitions from around the world to speak with Senators or Representatives about issues going on at home. Being the only youth representing Hawai'i I needed to prepare a speech to showcase that it is worth funding prevention work whether it be for underage drinking, drug misuse, vaping, etc. Not only was I speaking for HPPUD, but I needed to speak for all of the other prevention coalitions in Hawai'i. This was an amazing experience talking with them about a topic that I found a passion for.
