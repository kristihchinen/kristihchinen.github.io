**What This Project is About**

Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America is the leading substance abuse prevention organization that represents over 5,000 community based coalitions across America and in 22 countires who work to create safe, healthy and drug free communities. This organization assists communities by providing the support they need to become stronger and more effective in their prevention work. CADCA holds conferences twice a year. The first one is held every February in Washington DC. This conference is focused on meeting with the representatives and senators to talk about issues and give them an insight to what is happening at home. The second conference is usually held in June or July in different states every year. During this conference we learn different techniques other coalitions are using.

**My Involvement**

I started working with HPPUD in 2018 by managing all social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook). I was in charge of making sure content was posted weekly to hopefully bring up engagements on all platforms. I was also attending small conferences here to get familiar with the line of work and slowly make connections with other coalitions. The following year I was then chosen to travel to Washington DC to represent the youth of Hawai'i. For this training they were preparing all the coalitions from different states and territories to speak with Senators or Representatives about issues going on at home. Being the only youth representing Hawai'i I needed to prepare a speech to showcase that it is worth to continue funding prevention work whether it be for underage drinking, drug misuse, vaping, etc. We needed to make sure the Senators did not feel attacked with information, rather we were just informing them that prevention work is working and their funding is being put to good use.

**What I Learned**
