## The "Recipes" of Coding
What is the first thought that comes to mind when you hear the topic "Design Patterns"? Before taking this class the only design patters I ever heard about were dealing with arts or graphics. So, I automatically assumed it was how to make websites pretty, giving it an aesthetic look. Boy, was I wrong... Design patters are more like a template that can be used for most situations when you change it up to fit your specific situation. They are used to give you a generalized solution to problems that commonly occur. 

## Why Baking? 
I love to bake. So, during the pandemic I was baking cookies, cakes, breads, etc. After learning about design templates I thought it related to recipes. Why baking you may ask? Well, the recipe that you are given is a general template on how you can make something, it is your choice if you want to follow it or put your own twist to it.
