## What A Rough Start

Before actually choosing the major I wanted to declare I tried 2 different majors. After volunteering for the different jobs and taking a couple classes within the majors, I decided that it was not for me. One night I decided that I was going to major in Computer Science and not look back. Then, the pandemic hit. Having to switch to online in the middle of learning Javascript eventually made it a hard language for me to grasp. I started to fall behind in learning the new techniques which discouraged me from continuing on in my degree pathway. However, I did not want to give up and change my major again. I then started to code in other languages which were easier for me. It got me thinking I would never have to code in JavaScript again. Boy was I wrong, I met my enemy once again in ICS 314. 


## Starting From The Very Beginning

During our very first class our professor was going over what we will be during over the course of the semester. I remember him saying we will be using Javascript and my heart sank. I was not confident in my Javascript abilities and I felt people would look down on me because of that. However, I quickly learned that our professor wanted to set us up for success within his class. So, we were going back to the basics and doing a refresher course using FreeCodeCamp assignments. The FreeCodeCamp assignments truly helped me with learning the fundamentals and to get comfortable with them rather than jumping straight into coding. I have always been able to learn better with repetition and this assignment allowed me to do that. For a lot of classes we are given big assignments that take days to complete. I find that it is very difficult for me to learn that way because I feel overwhelmed to the point I do not want to do the assignment and push it aside to the very last minute. However, the FreeCodeCamp assignments not only gives me the repetition I need to learn, but I am able build upon my understanding to hopefully be able to put it all together in one big assignment.  Learning it a second time around was not as bad as I remember it being. Looking back I feel that because I was taught JavaScript before taking this class it allowed me to understand the concepts a lot easier the second time around.

## Dreading The Time

I was quite scared of the weekly workout of the day (WODs) because when you put a time limit for anything it always puts extra pressure on me. On top of the time limit we are getting tested on writing code for a certain prompt and with the WODs being worth so many points I wanted to make sure I did good on them. After going through the first WOD it helped me to realize that it is not that bad, if I just put the effort in to study every day I will be fine. The reputation of everything truly helps me to become more comfortable with Javascript. We are given all of the resources we need to succeed in this class, I just have to make it a point to do my share of the work and study.
