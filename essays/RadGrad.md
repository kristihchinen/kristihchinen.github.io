# A Little Background
While in college every student has one thing in the back of their mind, getting a good paying job after they graduate. Radgrad is a website that STEM undergraduates are able to use to improve their undergraduate experience. This website allows STEM majors (specifically computer science and computer engineer programs) access to various resources they can use to help them plan their future. 

# Being the "New" Kid 
When I first transferred to Manoa from the community college it was during the pandemic. Practically Spring of 2022 is my first time stepping foot on campus. I do not know any of the clubs that are offered or the various opportunities that are available to us. Radgrad has helped me to get a better understanding of the different opportunities. It takes my interests and goals into consideration and is able to give me a list of opportunities tailored to me. Radgrad has also helped me to plan my remaining semesters while adding in the different opportunities I can take advantage of.
