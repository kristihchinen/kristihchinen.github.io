# A Little Background
While in college every student has one thing in the back of their mind, getting a good paying job after they graduate, but not everyone is fortunate to land one after graduation. Now, thanks to Radgrad we are given the upper-hand when it comes to getting high paying jobs after graduation. Radgrad is a website that STEM undergraduates are able to use to improve their undergraduate experience. This website allows STEM majors (specifically computer science and computer engineer programs) access to various resources they can use to help them plan their future. 

# Being the "New" Kid 
When I first transferred to Manoa from the community college it was during the pandemic. Practically Spring of 2022 is my first time stepping foot on campus. My first time I had to come to class I felt so lost and unsure of where I was going. I also do not know any of the clubs that are offered or the various opportunities that are available to us. Radgrad has helped me to get a better understanding of the different opportunities. It takes my interests and goals into consideration and is able to give me a list of opportunities tailored to me. Radgrad has also helped me to plan my remaining semesters while adding in the different opportunities I can take advantage of. 

# It is Rad
Radgrad has helped me out a lot because I am able to clearly map out my future. It gives me a sense of direction and reassures me that what I am doing is best suited for me rather than doing what everyone else is doing. Being a Computer Science major and a female I am already stressing out with making sure I am learning my material and proving that I am able to hold my own. However, with Radgrad I am able to feel a weight lifted off my shoulders knowing I have the resources I need to potentially succeed after graduation.
