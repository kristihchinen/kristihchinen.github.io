There are so many subtopics that are involved when talking about computer science. Within each subtopic there is always something new to learn which can get confusing. Computer science it not like any other subject, you are expected to do it on your own and when you are asking for help you are expected to have a general idea of what you are talking about. This shows that you are not just finding the easy way out. It is always encouraged to ask questions. However, there is a certain way to ask a question to generate the answer you are looking for.

One of the first things I noticed with this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27242746/successful-purchase-but-has-class-not-found-when-unmarshalling-com-google-and) is no one has answered it and it was asked over 7 years ago. After reading the question one of the first things that popped into my mind was, this person did not even as a question. They simply stated what was wrong. From reading the article many "hackers" will have an idea of what you are asking/saying, but if you are asking it in the wrong way they will give you an answer based on what you asked.
