There are so many subtopics that are involved when talking about computer science. Within each subtopic there is always something new to learn which can get confusing. Computer science it not like any other subject, you are expected to do it on your own and when you are asking for help you are expected to have a general idea of what you are talking about. This shows that you are not just finding the easy way out. It is always encouraged to ask questions. However, there is a certain way to ask a question to generate the answer you are looking for. 

## Want to get Ignored? Try This
One of the first things I noticed with this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27242746/successful-purchase-but-has-class-not-found-when-unmarshalling-com-google-and) is no one has answered it and it was asked over 7 years ago. After reading the question one of the first things that popped into my mind was, this person did not even as a question. They simply stated what was wrong. From reading the article many "hackers" will have an idea of what you are asking/saying, but if you are asking it in the wrong way they will give you an answer based on what you asked. 

## Meeting Halfway 
After reading the [article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) I realized that you cannot expect the person you are asking a question to, to give you an answer without at least meeting them halfway. By meeting them halfway you are doing research on your question to make sure no one else has asked the same question. Then, upon doing research you find that no one else has asked the same question as you, so you turn to the experts. From there you clearly state what you are asking by also letting them know you did research before going to them for help. I feel this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it) clearly shows that. The person had a question and found an answer to their question by simply googling their question. However, they then encountered another issue that they were unable to google. They also provided the error message that appeared to show the experts exactly what the error message said. 

## Thinking Back 
In the past teachers always encourage asking questions by saying "there are no dumb questions." However, that is probably the farthest thing from the truth. There are "dumb" questions. When asking a question you need to be clear to get a clear answer, you also want to show that you at least tried to find the answer on your own before asking for help. These experts are willing to help you, you just need to meet them halfway.
