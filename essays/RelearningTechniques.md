## What A Rough Start

Having learned Javascript when the pandemic was first starting out and we were all pushed online it was a hard language for me to grasp. I started to fall behind in learning the new techniques which discouraged me from continuing on in my degree pathway. However, I did not want to give up and change my major again. I then started to code in other languages thinking I would never have to code in JavaScript again. Boy was I wrong, I took ICS 314 and we are being taught JavaScript. Looking back I feel that because I was taught JavaScript before taking this class it allowed me to understand a lot easier the second time around. 

## Starting From The Very Beginning

The FreeCodeCamp assignment truly helped me with learning the fundamentals rather than jumping straight into coding. It allowed me to get comfortable first. I have always been able to learn better with repetition and this assignment allowed me to do that. For a lot of classes they give big assignments that take days to complete rather than many small assignments to get you familiar with content. I have a difficult time with being assigned one big assignment because I feel overwhelmed to the point I do not want to do the assignment and push it to the side to the very end. Being given the option to constantly practice allows my brain to understand fully. Also, the breakdown of Javascript into different parts allows me to become more confident in coding which will help me to potentially create websites in the future.

## Dreading The Time

I was quite scared of the weekly workout of the day (WODs) because when you put time limit for anything it always puts extra pressure on me. On top of the time limit we are getting tested on writing code for a certain prompt and with the WODs being worth so many points just scared me. After going through the first WOD it helped me to realize that it is not that bad. If I just put the effort in to study every day, for a couple of hours a day I will be fine. The reputation of everything truly helps me to become more comfortable with Javascript.
