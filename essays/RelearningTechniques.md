## What A Rough Start

Having learned Javascript when the pandemic was first starting out and we were all pushed online it was a hard language for me to grasp. I started to fall behind in learning the new techniques which discouraged me from continuing on in my degree pathway. However, I did not want to give up and change my major again. I then started to code in other languages thinking I would never have to code in JavaScript again. Boy was I wrong, I took ICS 314 and we are being taught JavaScript. Looking back I feel that because I was taught JavaScript before taking this class it allowed me to understand a lot easier the second time around. 

## Starting From The Very Beginning

The FreeCodeCamp assignment truly helped me with learning the fundamentals and get comfortable with them rather than jumping straight into coding. I have always been able to learn better with repetition and this assignment allowed me to do that. For a lot of classes we are given big assignments that take days to complete. I find that it is very difficult for me to learn that way because I feel overwhelmed to the point I do not want to do the assignment and push it aside to the very last minute. However, with the FreeCodeCamp not only gives me the repetition I need to learn, but I am able build upon my understanding to hopefully be able to put it all together in one big assignment.  Also, the breakdown of Javascript into different parts allows me to become more confident with this language which will help me to potentially create websites in the future.

## Dreading The Time

I was quite scared of the weekly workout of the day (WODs) because when you put a time limit for anything it always puts extra pressure on me. On top of the time limit we are getting tested on writing code for a certain prompt and with the WODs being worth so many points just scared me. After going through the first WOD it helped me to realize that it is not that bad. If I just put the effort in to study every day, for a couple of hours a day I will be fine. The reputation of everything truly helps me to become more comfortable with Javascript. We are given all of the resources we need to succeed in this class, I just have to make it a point to do my share of the work and study.
