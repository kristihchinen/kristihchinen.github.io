**#What A Rough Start#**

Having learned Javascript last year when the pandemic was first starting out and we were all pushed online it was a hard language for me to grasp. I started to fall behind in learning the new techniques which discouraged me in becoming a programmer. However, learning it a second time around allows me to truly understand the basics of the language.

**#Starting From The Very Beginning#**

The FreeCodeCamp assignment truly helped me with learning the fundamentals rather than having us jump straight into coding. It allowed me to first get comfortable, I have always learned better with repetition and this assignment allowed me to do that. For a lot of classes they give big assignments that take days to complete rather than small assignments to get you familiar with content. I have a difficult time with that because I feel overwhelmed to the point I do not want to do the assignment and push it to the side to the very end. Being given the option to constantly practice allows my brain to understand fully. Also, the breakdown of Javascript into different parts allows me to become more confident in coding which will help me to potentially create websites in the future.

**#Dreading The Time#**

I was quite scared of the weekly workout of the day (WODs) because a time limit of anything always puts extra pressure on me. Then with getting tested on writing code in a certain amount of time and with the WODs being worth so many points just scared me. After going through the first WOD it helped me to realize that it is not that bad. If I just put the effort in to study every day, for a couple of hours a day I will be fine. The repetion of everything truly helps me to become more comfortable with Javascript.
