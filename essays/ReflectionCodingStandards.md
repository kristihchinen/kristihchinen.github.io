## Know The Difference

When I first was learning how to code I was never truly taught the Java Coding Standards. I got a general sense of what to do and what not to do based off of looking at the different codes teachers would right. However, for the most part, when coding I would write code in a way that it looked appealing to me. The further into my major I got the more I realized how easy it is to tell the difference between an experienced coder and a beginner just by looking at their codes. Within this class I was introduced to a helpful tool to use while coding that will help to find violations of the java coding standards within my JavaScript code. This tool is used in Intellij IDEA, which is called ESLint.

## My Background

Coming from a background where the java coding standards were never inforced I appreciate learning about these standards. In my previous classes when we would share our code with others I would have a dfficult time with understanding their code due to the fact it was so different. I know everyone codes differently, but these codes were very different because we were all coding in a way that looked appealing to us. With following these standards it allows everyone to follow a general template of how to write our codes.
