## Know The Difference

When I first was learning how to code I was never truly taught the Java Coding Standards. I got a general sense of what to do and what not to do based off of looking at the different codes teachers would right. However, for the most part, when coding I would write code in a way that it looked appealing to me. The further into my major I got the more I realized how easy it is to tell the difference between an experienced coder and a beginner just by looking at their codes. Within this class I was introduced to a helpful tool to use while coding that will help to find violations of the java coding standards within my JavaScript code. This tool is used in Intellij IDEA, which is called ESLint.

## My Appreciation For The Coding Standrds 

Coming from a background where the java coding standards were never inforced I appreciate learning about these standards. In my previous classes when we would share our code with others I would have a dfficult time with understanding their code due to the fact it was so different. I know everyone codes differently, but these codes were very different because we were all coding in a way that looked appealing to us. With following these standards it allows everyone to follow a general template of how to write our codes. When using the coding standards it will not only help others to read your code, but it will help you in the long run. If you need to refer back to a specific part of your code it will be easier to find/follow. 

## Conclusion 

When using the coding standards it will not affect your code that you create, but it will allow it to become more appealing to others reading your code. It will also allow you to come across less mistakes and help others to find mistakes in your code. It is a difficult concept to grasp t first. However, the more you practice the coding standards it will become second nature and help everyone in the long run.
