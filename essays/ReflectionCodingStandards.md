## Know The Difference

When I first was learning how to code I was never truly taught the Java Coding Standards. I got a general sense of what to do and what not to do based off of looking at the different codes teachers would right. However, for the most part, when coding I would write code in a way that it looked appealing to me. The further into my major I got the more I realized how easy it is to tell the difference between an experienced coder and a beginner just by looking at their codes. Within this class I was introduced to a helpful tool to use while coding that will help to find violations of the java coding standards within my JavaScript code. This tool is used in Intellij IDEA, which is called ESLint.
