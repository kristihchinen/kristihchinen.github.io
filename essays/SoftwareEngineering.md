## The Beginning 

I have always wanted to help people, I just always figured it would be in health care. After volunteering at a physical therapy clinic I decided that this might not be the way I want to help people, with technology growing every year I decided to take a couple of Computer Science. I really enjoyed my classes, but the down side was we always created code that would only be useful for that class. Although that is useful I wanted to create something that more people would be able to benefit from and has a greater impact on society as a whole.

## Fighting The Epidemic

While working with HPPUD I learned about the sex trafficking epidemic that is happening in Hawai'i. I realized I want to be able to expand on my knowledge and skills in ways to stop individuals from being shipped out of state. I would like to create a software that will be more efficient to track these individuals.

## Technology Makes Things Better

In the future I would hope to utilize my knowledge and skills gained through Software Engineering to create an all inclusive app for people to use. I envision this app to be a lifeline to victims where you can connect directly to specialist, counselors, families, and the police/FBI.  I also want to be able to educate others because this is a topic no one ever talks about. If I am able to reach these individuals through software/technology hopefully it will spread awareness and prevent more people from becoming victims.
