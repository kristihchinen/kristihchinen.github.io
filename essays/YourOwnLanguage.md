## Where it All Started 

When I first started my coding journey, my teacher would practically give me the answer if I was doing something wrong. I never understood what a coding standard was until I entered my ICS 211 class. Boy was that eye opening. I practically had to work harder than the rest of the class because I needed to relearn my foundation. That is where I learned how important a coding standard was. Then another eye opening even happened when I took a class that introduced Python, HTML, C++, and Perl. I had to learn different coding standards for the different languages and software I was using. However, with anything all it takes is practice and it becomes muscle memory. 

## Creating Our Own Success 

Everything we are doing in ICS 314 has a purpose aside from passing the class. We are learning skills that we can use in our careers to give us a broader background with the different software we are able to use. Currently we are learning how to use ESLint and Intellij. To date this has to be one of my favorite software to use because it checks my spelling errors and the capabilities seem endless.
