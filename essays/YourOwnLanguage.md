## Where it all Started 

When I first started my coding journey, my teacher would practically give me the answer if I was doing something wrong. I never understood what a coding standard was until I entered my ICS 211 class. Boy was that eye opening. I practically had to work harder than the rest of the class because I needed to relearn my foundation. That is where I learned how important a coding standard was. Then another eye opening even happened when I took a class that introduced Python, HTML, C++, and Perl. I had to learn different coding standards for the different languages and software I was using. However, with anything all it takes is practice and it becomes muscle memory.
