## Where it All Started 

When I first started my coding journey, my professor would practically give me the answer every time I asked for help. I always tried to understand how she came up with that answer, but I could never figure it out. I never understood what a coding standard was until I entered my ICS 211 class. Boy was that eye opening. I practically had to work harder than the rest of the class because I needed to relearn my foundation. That is where I learned how important coding standards were. In my previous class my professor would fix up my code and make it all nice but I never understood the reason behind it. I would then try to make my code nice like hers but I never understood the why or how until I took ICS 211. I actually took me a while to get used to following the coding standards, but with anything, the more you do it the more comfortable you become. 

## Learn The Difference

With the different languages comes slight differences and that comes with its pros and cons. For example, when working with Underscore it was a difficult transition from always writing code with loops to not using them at all. I honestly felt overwhelmed at first because all I knew was how to write loops, then we are thrown this curve ball. However, after getting the hang of Underscore it is actually so much easier not having to deal with loops. 

### Going from this:

    totalCost(){
        let cost = 0;
        for(let drink of this.drinks){
            cost += drink.price;
        }
        return cost;
    }

### To this: 

    function safe(data, year){
        const entry = _.find(data,entry => entry.year == year);
        return entry.mean < 351;
    }

## Creating Our Own Success 

Everything we are doing in ICS 314 has a purpose aside from passing the class. We are learning skills that we can use in our careers to give us a broader background with the different software we are able to use. Currently we are learning how to use ESLint and Intellij. To date this has to be one of my favorite software to use because it checks my spelling errors and the capabilities seem endless. It also forces me to follow the coding standards or else I will not have a green check mark at the top. ESLint allows me to see what exactly is wrong with my code allowing for an easy and quick fix. It will help me to hone my coding skills while following the coding standards helping me to become a better coder in the future.
