## Where it All Started 

When I first started my coding journey, my professor would practically give me the answer if I was doing something wrong. I never understood what a coding standard was until I entered my ICS 211 class. Boy was that eye opening. I practically had to work harder than the rest of the class because I needed to relearn my foundation. That is where I learned how important a coding standard was. In my previous class my professor would fix up my code and make it all nice but I never understood the reason behind it. I would then try to make my code nice like hers but I never understood the why or how until I took ICS 211.

## Creating Our Own Success 

Everything we are doing in ICS 314 has a purpose aside from passing the class. We are learning skills that we can use in our careers to give us a broader background with the different software we are able to use. Currently we are learning how to use ESLint and Intellij. To date this has to be one of my favorite software to use because it checks my spelling errors and the capabilities seem endless. It also forces me to follow the coding standards or else I will not have a green check mark at the top.
